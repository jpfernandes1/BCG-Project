### Task 1 - Understanding the business context and problem statement

On this project we'll work with PowerCo, which works with gas and electicity.
The goal is to look for churn reasons.

"Gain a better understanding of the problem our client is facing and translate the business problem into a data science one.
Think about how you would go about solving this, from the data you think is relevant,
to what modeling approach you would pursue, to how you would interpret the outcome"

During the meeting your Associate Director (AD) discussed some potential reasons for this churn, one being how “sensitive” the price is. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?

### AD Proposal

The AD would like you to investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor for a customer churning, and if not, to what extent does price sensitivity influence churn.
