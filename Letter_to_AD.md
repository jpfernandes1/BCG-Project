Hello, AD! How have you been?

We're engaged to helping you understand why you're having churn.
To do this, two steps will be executed:

1 - Descriptive analysis

A data mining is essential to understand some variables such as:
- The variation of the number of customers across the last five years (time series)
- The influence of customer location on churn
- The average customer ticket

2 - Predictive analysis

A logistic regression model can be very usefull to predict which customer
will churn as well as the most influential variables that causes it. 

To proceed with this two steps, please provide us with as much of the data below as possible:
